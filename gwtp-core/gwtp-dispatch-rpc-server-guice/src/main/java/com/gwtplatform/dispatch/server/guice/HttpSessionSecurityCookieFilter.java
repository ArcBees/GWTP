 * This filter will automatically inject a security cookie inside the request the first time the page is loaded. This
 * security cookie is based on the {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpSession} and will only work if the session is enabled.
 * To setup this
 * filter, add the following line at before any other {@code serve} call in your own
 * {@link com.google.inject.servlet.ServletModule#configureServlets}:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * filter(&quot;*.jsp&quot;).through(HttpSessionSecurityCookieFilter.class);
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * You also have to use a {@code .jsp} file instead of a {@code .html} as your main GWT file.
