/**
 * Instances of this interface will handle specific types of action classes on the client.
 * <p/>
 * When a call is executed, the {@link ClientActionHandler} that has been registered with the bound
 * {@link ClientActionHandlerRegistry} is called and
 * {@link com.gwtplatform.dispatch.rpc.shared.DispatchAsync DispatchAsync} or
 * {@link com.gwtplatform.dispatch.rest.shared.RestDispatch RestDispatch} does not automatically send the command over
 * HTTP to the server.
 * <p/>
 * Client Action Handlers provide a number of flexible options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The action can be modified before sending the action to the server.</li>
 * <li>A result can be returned without contacting the server.</li>
 * <li>The result can be modified or processed after it is returned from the server.</li>
 * <li>The {@link ClientActionHandler} can take over and communicate directly with the server, possibly using a
 * different mechanism.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <b>Important!</b> If your action handler makes asynchronous calls, be careful with your use of fields as a second
 * call your handler could be made while it is waiting for the asynchronous call to return.
