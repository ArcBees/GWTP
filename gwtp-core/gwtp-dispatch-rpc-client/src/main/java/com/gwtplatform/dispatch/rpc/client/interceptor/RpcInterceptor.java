/**
 * Instances of this interface will handle specific types of action classes on the client.
 * <p/>
 * When a call is executed, the {@link RpcInterceptor} that has been registered with the bound
 * {@link RpcInterceptorRegistry} is called and
 * {@link com.gwtplatform.dispatch.rpc.shared.DispatchAsync DispatchAsync} does not automatically
 * send the command over HTTP to the server.
 * <p/>
 * Interceptors provide a number of flexible options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The action can be modified before sending the action to the server.</li>
 * <li>A result can be returned without contacting the server.</li>
 * <li>The result can be modified or processed after it is returned from the server.</li>
 * <li>The {@link RpcInterceptor} can take over and communicate directly with the server, possibly using a
 * different mechanism.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <b>Important!</b> If your interceptor makes asynchronous calls, be careful with your use of fields as
 * a second call your interceptor could be made while it is waiting for the asynchronous call to return.
 * <p/>

 * }
 *
 * // abstract interceptor that:
 * // - first checks cache and returns result immediately if found in cache
 * // - executes command on server
 * // - saves result to cache before returning it
 * public abstract class AbstractCachingInterceptor&lt;A extends Action&lt;R&gt;, R&gt;

     * If the interceptor makes asynchronous calls, it is recommended that you confirm that this request has
     * not been cancelled after returning by calling
     * {@link com.gwtplatform.dispatch.client.DelegatingDispatchRequest#isPending()} against the request parameter.
     *
     * @param action      The action to undo.
     * @param result      The result to undo.
     * @param callback    The callback to use to indicate when the action has been undone. Unless the request is
     *                    cancelled, you must invoke {@link AsyncCallback#onSuccess} on this callback when you have
     *                    successfully undone the action. If any failure occurs call {@link AsyncCallback#onFailure}.
     * @param undoCommand Call {@link UndoCommand#undo(Object, Object,
     *                    com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.AsyncCallback)} on this object to send the action over to
     *                    the server via gwt-rpc. As a parameter you can pass {@code callback} or your custom
     *                    {@link AsyncCallback} if you want to perform any processing following the undo.
     * @return A {@link DispatchRequest} object. Never return {@code null}, instead return a new
     *         {@link com.gwtplatform.dispatch.client.CompletedDispatchRequest} if you executed,
     *         cancelled or ignored the action.
