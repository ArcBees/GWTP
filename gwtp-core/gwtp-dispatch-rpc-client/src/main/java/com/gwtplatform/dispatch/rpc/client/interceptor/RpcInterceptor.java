/**
 * Instances of this interface will handle specific types of action classes on the client.
 * <p/>
 * When a call is executed, the {@link RpcInterceptor} that has been registered with the bound {@link
 * RpcInterceptorRegistry} is called and {@link com.gwtplatform.dispatch.rpc.shared.DispatchAsync DispatchAsync} does
 * not automatically send the command over HTTP to the server.
 * <p/>
 * Interceptors provide a number of flexible options: <ul> <li>The action can be modified before sending the action to
 * the server.</li> <li>A result can be returned without contacting the server.</li> <li>The result can be modified or
 * processed after it is returned from the server.</li> <li>The {@link RpcInterceptor} can take over and communicate
 * directly with the server, possibly using a different mechanism.</li> </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <b>Important!</b> If your interceptor makes asynchronous calls, be careful with your use of fields as a second call
 * your interceptor could be made while it is waiting for the asynchronous call to return.
 * <p/>
