/**
 * Defines a class that will be executed after injection happens. Your bootstrapper must contain a default, empty
 * constructor or an {@linkplain javax.inject.Inject @Inject}ed constructor.
 * <p>
 * This class is responsible for calling {@link com.gwtplatform.mvp.client.proxy.PlaceManager#revealCurrentPlace
 * PlaceManager#revealCurrentPlace}. This is particularly useful when you need to do initialisation steps before the
 * first page is shown to the user.
 * <p>
 * Your bootstrapper must be configured by annotating a
 * {@link com.gwtplatform.common.client.annotations.GwtpApp @GwtpApp}-annotated class with
 * {@link com.gwtplatform.mvp.client.annotations.UseBootstrapper @UseBootstrapper}. Only
 * one such class is authorized in an application.
