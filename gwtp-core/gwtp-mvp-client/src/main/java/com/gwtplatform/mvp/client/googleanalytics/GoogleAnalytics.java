/**
 * This interface lets you manually register Google Analytics events in
 * your application.
 * <p/>
 * Event Tracking is a method available in the {@code ga.js} tracking code that
 * you can use to record user interaction with website elements. This is
 * accomplished by attaching the method call to the particular UI element you
 * want to track. When used this way, all user activity on such elements is
 * calculated and displayed as Events in the Analytics reporting interface.
 * Additionally, pageview calculations are unaffected by user activity tracked
 * using the Event Tracking method. Finally, Event Tracking employs an
 * object-oriented model that you can use to collect and classify different
 * types of interaction with your web page objects.
 * <p/>
 * Inject this interface in your presenters when you need to interact with the
 * Google Analytics module, for example to log your custom event. You can
 * also configure automatic registration of navigation event using
 * {@link GoogleAnalyticsNavigationTracker}.
 * <p/>
 * Also, for more information about Event Tracking, please read:
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/eventTrackerGuide.html">Event Tracking Guide</a>
