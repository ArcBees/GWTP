 * Use this to annotate an event-handling method that should be registered in

 * in this way should not be registered in the Presenter.
 * <p/>
 * The presenter will be instantiated as soon as the proxy intercepts the event, so
 * the presenter will handle the event even if it was not yet initialized.
 * <p/>
 * Methods annotated by {@code @ProxyEvent} must return {@code void} and accept
 * a single parameter derived from {@link com.google.web.bindery.event.shared.Event Event}.
 * This event class must have a static {@code getType} method returning a type
 * derived from {@link com.google.web.bindery.event.shared.Event.Type Type}.
