/**
 * Use this annotation if you want to have certain
 * {@link com.gwtplatform.mvp.client.proxy.Proxy}s and their associated
 * {@link com.gwtplatform.mvp.client.Presenter}s to sit behind one split point
 * and to be compiled into one javascript file seperately from others.
 * <p/>
 * Use this annotation if you already have too much code splitting using
 * {@link ProxyCodeSplit} and it is more efficient to group
 * {@link com.gwtplatform.mvp.client.Presenter}s because they share a bulk of
 * their code. You will also have to set up your own implementation of a
 * {@link ProviderBundle}.
 * <p/>
 * Here is an example use of {@link ProxyCodeSplitBundle}:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;ProxyCodeSplitBundle(bundleClass = MyPresenterBundle.class, id = MyPresenterBundle.ID_Object1)
 * public interface MyProxy extends ProxyPlace&lt;Object1&gt; {
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see ProviderBundle
 * @see <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html">Code Splitting</a>
