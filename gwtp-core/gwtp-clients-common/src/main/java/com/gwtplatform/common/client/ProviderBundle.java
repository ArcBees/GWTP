/**
 * This class can be used to contain a group of providers that should all sit
 * behind the same split point. That is, if the code for one provided object is
 * loaded, so is the code for the others. This is useful when the provided
 * objects share the bulk of their code, which would end up in the left-overs if
 * the objects were behind their individual split points.
 * GWTP automatically handles ProviderBundles when used with ApplicationController
 * and Ginjector generation.
 * <p/>
 * Here is an example use of a manual {@link ProviderBundle}:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyPresenterBundle extends ProviderBundle {
 *   public final static int ID_Object1 = 0;
 *   public final static int ID_Object2 = 1;
 *   public final static int BUNDLE_SIZE = 2;
 *
 *   &#064;Inject
 *   MyPresenterBundle(
 *       final Provider<Object1> object1Provider,
 *       final Provider<Object2> object2Provider) {
 *     super( BUNDLE_SIZE );
 *     providers[ID_Object1] = object1Provider;
 *     providers[ID_Object2] = object2Provider;
 *   }
 * }</pre>
