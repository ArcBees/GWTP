/**
 * Use this to annotate an event-handling method that should be registered in
 * the proxy rather than being registered in the presenter. Handlers annotated
 * in this way should not be registered in the Presenter.
 * <p />
 * The presenter will be instantiated as soon as the proxy intercepts the event, so
 * the presenter will handle the event even if it was not yet initialized.
 * <p />
 * Methods annotated by {@code @ProxyEvent} must return {@code void} and accept
 * a single parameter derived from {@link com.google.gwt.event.shared.GwtEvent GwtEvent}.
 * This event class must have a static {@code getType} method returning a type
 * derived from {@link com.google.gwt.event.shared.GwtEvent.Type Type}.
